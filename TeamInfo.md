## Project Summary

We are interested in the achievements & participation situation of the world athletes in the 2021 Olympics, a special Olympics during the Covid-19 pandemic. Thus we decide to build a project which is going to show 2021 Olympics data sorted by the usersâ€™ preference. People can have a clear glance of the kinds of data of the athletes sorted by different aspects, like coaches, countries, athletes, etc. We will also further our development on the exhibition of the data by including charts built by the data in the app.

The project is separated into three parts - designing, developing and testing. It is predictable that there will be challenges when we implement chart functions in the app, which means we will allocate more time on developing the app. This app will be useful for educating students and bringing a quick way to search data for people who keep a watchful eye on the 2021 Olympics sports. People are able to register for their own accounts to enjoy personalized functions.
